# Rockbuster-Stealth-SQL
In this project, I analyzed Rockbuster Stealth's data using PostgreSQL and Tableau to answer key business queries, identify top-performing movies, map customer geography, and compare regional sales. I also created a presentation for business managers, compiled an Excel file with SQL queries and data outputs for technical colleagues, and prepared a data dictionary.

## Objective
<img src="https://cdni.iconscout.com/illustration/premium/thumb/live-streaming-service-5513844-4603371.png?f=webp" width="220">
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department is preparing the launch strategy for a new online video service. The BI department assists various other departments, ranging from inventory management to customer insights, with data-related queries.

### Key Questions
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

### Data Sources
_The Rockbuster dataset was created by CareerFoundry for use in this analysis. The data set includes information on stores, staff, inventory, film categories, film names, film language, actors, customers, rental history, payment history, and addresses for stores, staff, and customers._
